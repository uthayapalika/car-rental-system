## Database

The application uses **SQLite** as its local database.

SQLite was selected because:

* No database server installation is required
* The database is stored locally
* It is lightweight
* It is suitable for a small desktop application
* It is easy to back up and restore

### Main Data Areas

The database manages information related to:

* Users
* Customers
* Vehicles
* Vehicle categories
* Bookings
* Payments
* Maintenance records

The database is automatically used by the application and does not require a separate database server.

---

## Versioning

The project uses **Git** for source-code version control and follows a release-based versioning approach.

### Current Version

```text
v1.0.0
```

### Version Format

The project follows the general:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

format.

Example:

```text
v1.0.0
v1.1.0
v1.1.1
v2.0.0
```

Major versions may introduce significant changes, while minor and patch versions are used for new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

The following features are not fully implemented in version **1.0.0**:

* Password reset functionality
* Email notification functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Application does not start

Make sure Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

Then activate the virtual environment:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Database Error

If the database has not been initialized, run:

```bash
python setup_db.py
```

Make sure the SQLite database file is located in the expected application directory.

### Login Problems

Check that:

* The username is correct.
* The password is correct.
* The user account exists in the database.
* The user has an assigned role.
* The database is accessible.

### Application Log

Application errors and events can be checked in:
